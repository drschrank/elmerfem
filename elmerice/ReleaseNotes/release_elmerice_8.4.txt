Elmer/Ice Release Notes for Elmer 8.4
-------------------------------------

* Added F90 functions for ice heat capacity and conductivity as well as
  for pressure melting point added via USF_Iceproprerties.F90 including
  two tests for TemperateIceSolver. They can be called via:
   Temp Heat Capacity = Variable Temp
    Real Procedure "ElmerIceUSF" "IceCapacity"
  and
   Temp Heat Conductivity = Variable Temp
    Real Procedure "ElmerIceUSF" "IceConductivity"
  as well as
    Temp Upper Limit = Variable HydroPressure
    Real Procedure "ElmerIceUSF" "IcePressureMeltingPoint"
  By default those functions  accept arguments and deliver output in
  SI units. There can be scaling factors passed to each of them, like:
     Heat Capacity Scaling Factor = Real $(secondsperyear)^(2.0)
     Heat Conductivity Scaling Factor = Real $(secondsperyear)*1.0E-06
     Pressure Scaling Factor = Real 1.0E06

* Introduced fixes to grounding line code. Previously USF_Contact only
  compared the magnitude of flow solution loads and fwater, ignoring the
  direction. GetHydrostaticLoads has been modified to include contributions
  from other boundary conditions (i.e. the ice/ocean front) because flow
  solution loads includes these.

* Introduced new scalar product definition for Beta Adjoint optimisation.
  By default, the minimisation procedure (using m1qn3) uses the Euclidean
  scalar product so that the gradients of the cost function are proportional
  to the area surrounding the nodes. For unstructured meshes where element
  size varies by orders of magnitude with no relation to the velocity magnitude,
  this may result in significant mesh dependence. The new scalar product
  attempts to solve this problem by normalising the gradient values by the
  'boundary weight', i.e. the element area seen by each node. 
  This option can be enabled by setting:    
    Mesh Independent = Logical True
  in the Optimize_m1qn3 solver section. 

* Elmer/Ice-sheetIntroduced standard configuration files
  to run ice-sheet wide simulations with Elmer, see
  http://elmerice.elmerfem.org/elmer-ice-sheet for more details.
    
* Added GlaDS solvers (basal hydrology) and 4 Tests for these solvers.
  Usage of these solvers are documented on the wiki
  http://elmerfem.org/elmerice/wiki/doku.php?id=solvers:glads

* New SSA-FS coupler implemented, including testcase.
  Introduced a new solver SSAmask that marks full-Stokes and SSA areas.
  Method can be checked in elmerice/Tests/MISMIP_FS-SSA

* New entropy-based temperature solver elmerice/Solvers/EnthalpySolver.F90
  Usage of this solvers are documented on the wiki
  http://elmerfem.org/elmerice/wiki/doku.php?id=solvers:enthalpy 
  There is and associated test elmerice/Tests/Enthalpy.
  It follows the approach described in :

	Aschwanden, A., E. Bueler, C. Khroulev, and H. Blatter (2012),
	An enthalpy formulation for glaciers and ice sheets,
	Journal of Glaciology,
	58(209), 441â€“457, doi:10.3189/2012JoG11J088.
