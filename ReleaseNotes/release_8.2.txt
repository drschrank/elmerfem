Elmer Release Notes for version 8.2
===================================

Previous release: 8.1
Period covered: 30 October 2015 - 11 March 2016


ElmerSolver libary functionality
--------------------------------
- Added support for MKL Parallel Direct Sparse Direct Solver for Clusters.

- Internal spline integration added. The integral curve is computed while adding the 
  data to the list to speed up calculation of definite integrals (IntegrateCurve()).

- Implement reduction operators for components. These are similar to the ones that exist already in
  SaveScalars but they operate only on the "Master Bodies" and "Master Boundaries" as defined in the 
  component section.  

- Mesh multiplication implemented for elementtype 706 (prisms) 

- Implemented automated overlay also with dimensionally reduced projectors. 

- Hierarchic edge element (curl-conforming) basis functions of second order for all basic element shapes 
  (pyramid still missing). The background mesh may then consist of nodal elements of either first or second degree.

- Documentation (in ElmerSolver Manual) for advanced finite element definitions


ElmerSolver Solver modules
---------------------------
- MagnetoDynamics
  o The AV solver updated to support the discretization with new second-order edge elements

- MagnetoDynamicsCalcFields (post-processor for MgDyn solvers):
  o Correct treatment of generalized nodal forces also for nonlinear H-B curves. 
  o Include airgap model in the generalized nodal forces computation. Only applicable to elemental fields.
  o Allow magnetic force reduction computation to components. These are activated by the logical keywords
    "calculate magnetic force" and "calculate magnetic torque". If airgap exists, then proper reduction
    requires use of elemental forces. 

- HeatSolver
  o Enable > spatial 2 < phase change model also with enthalpy given by a UDF by implementing automated numerical derivation. 
  o Allow phase change cases to be a combination of enthalpy and latent heat. Previously heat capacity needed to be intagrated.
  o Allow combination of 2D and 3D heat solver by adding a keyword for the 2D part thickness 

- FlowSolver
  o Better implementation of P2-P1/Q2-Q1 approximation to avoid computational instabilities. 
    Use Stabilization Method={p2p1|p2/p1} to select this approximation method.

- ParStokes (Stokes equations) solver
  o P2-P1/Q2-Q1 approximation over nodal elements of second degree
  o Default values introduced to simplify writing of sif files in the case of block preconditioning
  o Elmer Models Manual documentation created for the ParStokes solver

- CoilSolver
  o The coil position can now be automatically found from the maximum moment of inertia
  o Support of several coils where each coil is defined in component section
  o Parallelized the coil solver

- StructuredMeshMapper
  o Added support for mid-layer when doing mappings.

- ResultOutputSolver:
  o In VTU output implemented minimal discontinuous basis for DG fields where discontinuity is maintaied only over 
    body interfaces. Activated by "Discontinuous Bodies = Logical True" keyword.
    If discontinous reduction is used, the results are averaged for the representative node. 

- SaveScalars
  o Allow saving of results computed in Components by "Save Component Results" keyword. 


ElmerGrid
---------
- Added offset for materials and bc indexes when doing cloning of meshes
- When doing partitioning with connected sets, allow hybrid partitioning also with geometric version
